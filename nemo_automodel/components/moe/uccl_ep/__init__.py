"""UCCL-EP integration for expert parallelism.

UCCL-EP (https://github.com/uccl-project/uccl/tree/main/ep) has the same
interface and functionality as DeepEP, and enables GPU-initiated communication
for MoE models across heterogeneous GPUs and NICs.

Vendored files (from https://github.com/uccl-project/uccl/tree/main/ep/deep_ep_wrapper):
    _buffer.py  <- deep_ep_wrapper/deep_ep/buffer.py
    _utils.py   <- deep_ep_wrapper/deep_ep/utils.py

Usage:
    Set dispatcher: uccl_ep in the model backend config.
